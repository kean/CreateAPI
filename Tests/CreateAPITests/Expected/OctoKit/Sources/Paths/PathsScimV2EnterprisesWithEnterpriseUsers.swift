This can happen in certain cases where an external identity associated with an organization will not match an organization member:

        ///   - When a user is invited over SCIM, an external identity is created that matches with the invitee's email address. However, this identity is only linked to a user account when the user accepts the invitation by going through SAML SSO.
        /// 
        /// The returned list of external identities can include an entry for a `null` user. These are unlinked SAML identities that are created when a user goes through the following Single Sign-On (SSO) process but does not sign in to their GitHub account after completing SSO:

        ///    - If the user signs in, their GitHub account is linked to this entry.
        ///    - If the user does not sign in (or does not create a new account when prompted), they are not added to the GitHub enterprise, and the external identity `null` entry remains in place.
